<h3>About Us</h3>
<div>

<p>Were glad you somehow stumbled on this wonderful website here is a little bit about us!</p>
<p>Welcome to the <strong>Lucky 4 Lottery</strong> page.  We are a lottery unlike the rest, kinda sorta.  Lucky 4 was created by big brains for big brains.  The number selection and payout process are more complex than ordinary lotteries, but actually gives you better odds of a positive return.</p>
<p>Our main competitors, MegaMillions and Powerball, do questionable things with their profits.  You can rest assured that Lucky 4 profits are put to good use like bribing public officials, funding political assassinations in Central America, staging military coups in the Middle East and South Asian, and building homes for the less fortunate in and around major cities in the United States.  We believe these efforts perfectly align with our mission statement: "Money Solves ALL Problems."  Thank you, again, for visiting our website and we hope you enjoy playing Lucky 4. BEST OF LUCK!</p>
