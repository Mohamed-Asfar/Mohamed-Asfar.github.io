            <p>This website is obnoxious for this being a powerhouse company, it tears my eyes trying to look at it. This page pretty much has no CSS.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Harsh on the eyes, The link colors burn.</li>
                <li>Repitition: The only repitition was the constant lack of CSS </li>
                <li>Alignment: For the website alignment was ok due to its function and nature 5/10.</li>
                <li>Proximity: This looks like a jumbled ball of garbage.</li>
